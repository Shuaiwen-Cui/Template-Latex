Capturing structural transient responses under sudden events, e.g., earthquakes, is a critical challenge for wireless Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems deployed on resource-constrained edge devices. To address it, researchers are developing event-triggered sensing to detect events while enhancing energy efficiency. However, this technology is fundamentally constrained by the selection of triggering conditions, e.g., vibration threshold, which are mostly based on empirical values and lack the adaptability required to handle dynamic and unpredictable environments. Such limitations give rise to an inherent trade-off between missed triggers and false triggers, hence possibly failing to satisfy practical application demands. To achieve the optimal triggering conditions that may vary under changing environments, this study introduces an adaptive triggering mechanism powered by edge intelligence and accelerated by Digital Twin (DT). By embedding adaptivity into the sensing process, the proposed approach dynamically optimizes critical parameters to achieve both detection accuracy and energy efficiency. In particular, anchored in a Feedback Control (FC) framework, the proposed mechanism leverages Bayesian Optimization (BO) and lightweight neural networks to address the challenges of data scarcity, data imbalance, partial observability, and high observation costs. Experimental validation on LiftNode, a low-power IoT sensor node, demonstrates the frameworkâ€™s capability to significantly enhance detection performance ($F_{\beta}$) by around 30\% while maintaining energy efficiency, marking a transformative step toward more reliable and sustainable SHM deployments.
